# Methods for determining the coordinates of an object

## Project overview

This project exhibits three distinct approaches to estimate an object's position using measurements from stationary reference points, namely bases. 
These approaches encompass trilateration, triangulation, and gradient descent. 
The algorithms undergo testing both in pristine conditions and with introduced noise to mimic real-world imprecisions.

## Prerequisites

Install Node.js

## How to run the app

- Run in the teminal:
```Bash
npm i tsc
```

- Run npm start.
```Bash
npm start
```
